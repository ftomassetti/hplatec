=======

Wrapper for [plate-tectonics](https://github.com/ftomassetti/plate-tectonics) in Haskell.

Plate-tectonics is my fork of [platec](http://sourceforge.net/projects/platec/), a library to simulate plate tectonics, which is fundamental to generate realistic worlds.

This program generates an heightmap of the final state of the generation (serialized with google protocol buffer).
It also generated an animated GIF showing the generation process.
